# IsaacVR
I'm trying to recreate the rogue-like game The Binding of Isaac in VR, with Unity. 

Feel free to clone the repository to open the project in Unity, or download the .zip file with the game already exported. 

The game only work with Oculus now!

Feel free to give me feedback in Discord :)
